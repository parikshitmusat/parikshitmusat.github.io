      <p class="lg:w-1/2 w-full leading-relaxed text-base">The Parikshit satellite is a collaborative venture undertaken by the undergraduate students at the Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT), under the guidance of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). We aim to design, build and launch a 2U class satellite, while simultaneously learning, educating and carrying out research in the field of aerospace. This means nurturing students and helping them cultivate the necessary skills they’ll require to rise to the challenges posed by the country’s space program. Together, we make up an interdisciplinary team consisting of students from across the institute with subsystems ranging from on-board data handling to thermals and structures.
 The satellite’s payloads are a terrestrial thermal imaging camera, which will capture images of the Indian subcontinent and an electrodynamic tether, which will deorbit the satellite at the end of its lifespan. The goal of the satellite is not only to succeed in the launch and collect data from the imaging payload but also the realization of a new deorbiting mechanism – the electrodynamic tether.
 A space project requires management and guidance for it to be successful for which the project has been divided into subsystems –
 ·       ADCS – Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem
·       COMMS – Communications and Ground Station Subsystem
·       EPS – Electrical Power Subsystem
·       ODHS – On-Board Data Handling Subsystem
·       Payload Subsystem
·       STMS – Structures, Thermal and Mechanic Subsystem
 As with all space projects, Parikshit is divided into logical stages, called phases. Each individual phase is designed to end with a chief milestone in development, such as proof of concept, assembly of the satellite, launch, etc.
 Since the advent of the project in 2010, the satellite has been planned, designed, built and tested exclusively by undergrad students under the guidance of ISRO and MIT faculty, the utterly autonomous satellite will contribute to the country’s space research program. It will increase students exposure to the space industry and in the process, make MAHE a hub for space technology.
